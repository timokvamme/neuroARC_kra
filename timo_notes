# Goal was to create structral connectomes / tractography on the krakow site
# after the CFIN preprocessing pipeline had been run on CogSensGlobal 2022.
# also the Freesurfer had been run on each subject

# after instructions from Claude i downloaded this  https://github.com/MassimoLumaca/neuroARC/tree/main
# it was copied to this folder in mi,  /analses/aim1/struct_connectome_tractography
# I updated MRtrix 3 on my local account

# with a terminal to hyades:

cd /projects/2022_MR-SensCogGlobal/scripts

conda install -c mrtrix3 mrtrix3

# run:
mrinfo

# you should see:
MRtrix 3.0.4                         mrinfo                          Dec 14 2022

# I found the corresponding krakow id that is the freesurfer id, and their stormd_id and saved it to a csv file and did
# and did some cleaning on that, in the remade scripts i look this id up. for freesurfer sub folders.


# i step up all the steps in the folder, for step 1,2,3,4,5.. 5 is tricky cuz of the diffrent atlases, desikan and desitrux.
# i also am in doubt about T1, folder. ill have to get info from claude on that
# and the LUT on step5.


# but you can test step 0, to see that the freesurfer id works
# also in step 1 for example:

# stand in the folder, but running cd below:
# cd /projects/MINDLAB2016_MR-SensCogFromNeural/scratch/timo/mi/analyses/aim1/kra_struct_connectome_tractography
# you might need to run:
# chmod +x mrtrix_pipeline_step_1.sh

# ./mrtrix_pipeline_step_1.sh 0001 /projects/2022_MR-SensCogGlobal/scratch


it complaied about imp

some of those issues might be because i need to run with python=3.10

# so i did: (and set it in pycharm, my IDE)

conda create -n mrtrix python=3.10
conda activate mrtrix
conda install -c mrtrix3 mrtrix3
conda activate mrtrix


i think i need to "conda activate mrtrix"
conda activate mrtrix

before each run?. YES. i need to do it in the terminal. conda activate mrtrix every time.

# need to install fsl.
# https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/linux

I downloaded the fslinstaller.py
python fslinstaller.py

# into dir "/users/timo/my_fsl"
conda activate /users/timo/my_fsl


#  so i can either have mrtrix3 but not together

but if i instead just conda activate mrtrix  AND!:

export FSLDIR=~/my_fsl
export PATH=$FSLDIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FSLDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export FSLOUTPUTTYPE=NIFTI_GZ
source $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh

conda activate mrtrix
